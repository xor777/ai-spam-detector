A simple Telegram bot that i wrote to combat spam in my lovely Tesla chat.
At first, I tested it with a local LLM like Llama3, but then GPT-4o was released, which is faster, better, and cheaper
since Llama requires quite a relatively beefy hosting setup.

7-1-2025:
- Added structured output to the model.
- Now bot uses DeepSeek Chat model.
